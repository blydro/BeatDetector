BeatDetector.js

A pretty rudimentary but working beat detector. Built using the Web audio api. 
Based on comparing average shift in freq amplitudes in a current sample to a sample history.
Catches heavy beat hits pretty accurately (techno, house, hip hop, that kinda stuff)
 
BPM calculation funcionality mostly for kicks: don't use it for anything exact, there are
far better options. 
 
Based on the frequency select-algorithm (the web audio api does fft-calculations for us) but without band splitting from:

Example usage: 
 
var song = new stasilo.BeatDetector( {sens: 5.0, visualizerFFTSize: 256, analyserFFTSize: 256,
passFreq: 600, url: "file.mp3"} ); 



Settings:

sens
Sensitivity of the algorithm - a value between 1 and 16 
(1 - low threshold, 16 - high treshold) should do it. 
Requires a bit of trail and error tweaking for the sweet spot. (required)


visualizerFFTSize		
Size of fft calculation for visualizations (default: 256)
Must be a power of two (2^7 = 128, 2^8 = 256, 2^9 = 512, ...)



analyserFFTSize	
Size of fft calculation for the algorithm (default: 256) 
Must be a power of two (2^7 = 128, 2^8 = 256, 2^9 = 512, ...)



passFreq				
Float. If supplied, passes audio through a bandpass filter with a peak at this
frequency before passing it on to the algorithm. Suitable for example when a song
has a loud treble/mid section and you'd like to detect bass drum beats, 
in which case a bandpass at 100-800Hz could help you out. (default: off)

url
Url to audio file (detection defaults to microphone if no url is supplied)




loop					
Boolean. Whether to loop the sound or not. Default: false. 




playbackFinished		
A callback run at the end of playback.. 




progress(obj)			
A callback run while sound is downloading from url. 
An object of {percent: value, complete: boolean} is passed as an argument. 



To get frequency data for drawing bars and what not:

song.getAudioFreqData()

This returns an array of visualizerFFTSize/2 data values corresponding to frequency amplitudes.

To detect a beat hit:

Call song.isOnBeat() from the render loop of your script. 
Returns true if on a beat. 
 
For everything else: rtfs.
